# Water Quality Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction
The objective is to evaluate the potability of a water sample for drinking purposes by conducting a thorough analysis of its content. This assessment will help determine whether the water meets the necessary quality and safety standards for human consumption.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
The first step in this EDA project is to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This includes tasks such as handling missing values, detecting and correcting outliers, and transforming data into appropriate formats.
We use the following libraries to clean and prepare the data:
Pandas
Numpy

For Visualization:
Seaborn
Matplotlib

Initial Analysis
With the exception of the target feature, all other features within the dataset consist of floating-point values, indicating their continuous nature. 
A potential solution is to transform the Potability feature into a categorical variable, allowing for a more structured and meaningful representation in the analysis. 
This conversion can facilitate a better understanding of the data and its potential impact on the target variable.

# Conclusion
The performance metrics of the machine learning models employed in our analysis showcase varying degrees of accuracy. The Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy of 72%, while the Random Forest Classifier demonstrated a higher accuracy at 79%. 
These findings provide valuable insights into the predictive capabilities of these models, laying the foundation for informed decision-making in our analytical pursuits.
