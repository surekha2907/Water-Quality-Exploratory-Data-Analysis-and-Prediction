# Water Quality Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction
The objective is to evaluate the potability of a water sample for drinking purposes by conducting a thorough analysis of its content. This assessment will help determine whether the water meets the necessary quality and safety standards for human consumption.

# Data Cleaning and Preparation
The first step in this EDA project is to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This includes tasks such as handling missing values, detecting and correcting outliers, and transforming data into appropriate formats.
We use the following libraries to clean and prepare the data:
Pandas
Numpy

For Visualization:
Seaborn
Matplotlib
